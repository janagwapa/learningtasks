    <p> 
If all the world and love were young,<br>
And truth in every Shepherd's tongue,<br>
These pretty pleasures might me move,<br>
To live with thee, and be thy love. <br><br><br>
      
Time drives the flocks from field to fold,<br>
When Rivers rage and Rocks grow cold,<br>
And Philomel becometh dumb,<br>
The rest complains of cares to come. <br><br><br>
      
The flowers do fade, and wanton fields,<br>
To wayward winter reckoning yields,<br>
A honey tongue, a heart of gall,<br>
Is fancy's spring, but sorrowâ€™s fall. <br><br><br>

Thy gowns, thy shoes, thy beds of Roses,<br>
Thy cap, thy kirtle, and thy posies<br>
Soon break, soon wither, soon forgotten:<br>
In folly ripe, in reason rotten. <br><br><br>
 
Thy belt of straw and Ivy buds,<br>
The Coral clasps and amber studs,<br>
All these in me no means can move<br>
To come to thee and be thy love.<br><br><br>
      
But could youth last, and love still breed,<br>
Had joys no date, nor age no need,<br>
Then these delights my mind might move<br>
To live with thee, and be thy love. <br><br><br>
