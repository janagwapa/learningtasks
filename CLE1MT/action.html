    <p1> Spread Awareness </p1> <br> <br>
    <p2> The first thing we can do is of course to spread awareness on the issue. 
      If more people become aware of what is happening, then the listed ways we can help will follow naturally. 
      The more people we can get in on the conversation, 
      then all the more ways we can create initiatives to help our farmers.
      We should not remain ignorant and blindsided when we know we have the means to help out.

    <p3> Join Non-profit Social Media Groups/Organizations </p3> <br> <br>
    <p4>Nowadays, people like to shop for their items through online shopping. So, with everyone already on their mobile devices, why not purchase rice directly 
      from our farmers through different social media and other online platforms as well? 

      There are online platforms such as Session Groceries and Rice Pinas that source rice directly from our local farmers straight to us for reasonable prices. 
      Session Groceries even has a mobile app now, 
      similar to online grocery shopping. You can check out other groups on Facebook, cause there’s a lot. These two are just the more well-known ones.

    <p5>Buy from local markets</p5> <br> <br>
    <p6>
      One of the reasons also why our local rice is priced higher in supermarkets is because of so-called “middlemen.” 
      Middlemen can be in the form of individuals, companies, and big corporations. 
      They get the produce of farmers to the market as most of our farmers do not have the capacity to do so. 

      This process, however, adds additional fees to the product— fees that do not go to our farmers. 

      What we can do is to buy directly from local markets or palengekes. 
      If we have the capability to go to these, then we should buy from them without the interference of middlemen. 
      Some groups even set up local markets nearer to the city for our convenience, and you can even meet the farmers themselves!

    <p7>Be consistent</p7> <br> <br>
    <p8>Action for change isn’t a one-time movement. If you really want to help, 
      then participate in the fight regularly as much as you can. Through our continuous support for our Filipino rice farmers,
      maybe at some point, we can create a regular local demand for their produce; 
      which will hopefully create a sustainable source of income for them in the years to come.
