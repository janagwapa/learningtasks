    <p1> Spread Awareness </p1> <br> <br>
    <p2> The first thing we can do is of course to spread awareness on the issue. 
      If more people become aware of what is happening, then the listed ways we can help will follow naturally. 
      The more people we can get in on the conversation, 
      then all the more ways we can create initiatives to help our farmers.
      We should not remain ignorant and blindsided when we know we have the means to help out.

    <p3> Join Non-profit Social Media Groups/Organizations </p3> <br> <br>
    <p4>Nowadays, people like to shop for their items through online shopping. So, with everyone already on their mobile devices, why not purchase rice directly 
      from our farmers through different social media and other online platforms as well? 

      There are online platforms such as Session Groceries and Rice Pinas that source rice directly from our local farmers straight to us for reasonable prices. 
      Session Groceries even has a mobile app now, 
      similar to online grocery shopping. You can check out other groups on Facebook, cause thereâ€™s a lot. These two are just the more well-known ones.  </p4>
