    <p1> Spread Awareness </p1>
    <p2> The first thing we can do is of course to spread awareness on the issue. 
      If more people become aware of what is happening, then the listed ways we can help will follow naturally. 
      The more people we can get in on the conversation, 
      then all the more ways we can create initiatives to help our farmers.
      We should not remain ignorant and blindsided when we know we have the means to help out.
